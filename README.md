# Swagger to JS & Typescript Codegen (with improved form-data file upload support)

[The original version of this pacakge](https://github.com/wcandillon/swagger-js-codegen) is no longer being maintained.

This is just a forked version of that project with support for file uploads using `{ 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }` as is required by some microservices.
